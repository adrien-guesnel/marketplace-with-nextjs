# Marketplace with Next.JS

A technical demonstration of a marketplace with a single web page application.

## Run the project locally

```
nvm use # or use node 16.11.1
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000 to see the marketplace.

**Note : It really important to have the project on this url because we call an api to this url.**

## Functionnalities

You can filers items with the search field and with the price filters (min and max).

Others functionnalities are not implemented.
